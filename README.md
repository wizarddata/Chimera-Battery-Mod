# Chimera-Battery-Mod
This is a mod designed to add a convenient battery holder and power switch to the Chimera family of wireless keyboards. The below pictures establish both the orientation of the battery tray on the mod and of the mod on the keyboard. I suggest measuring the polarity of the bolt heads while the keyboard is running before you start and of the mod with a battery installed separate from your keyboard.

Battery Holder: BU2032SM-JJ-GTR  
Switch: JS202011SCQN  
Nylon Spacer:0.25" thick x 0.375" OD
